# Hogwarts Personality Quiz

Application allows a user to determine their Hogwarts house role.

This application was created for a school assignment.
The focus was to practice utilizing multiple view controllers and to have multiple storyboard scenes.

Challenges:
  - Disallowing users to revert to a previous question
  - Preventing questions from being duplicated
  - Loading different views based on presented questions

What I learned:
  - Navigational Scenes
  - Model setups
  - Proper view controller setups
  - Array object utilization
  - Having different views load per object scenario
  
 Extras to do:
  - Allow for questions to be pulled randomly
  - Allow users to choose multiple quizzes
  - Allow for users to share their results to friends
